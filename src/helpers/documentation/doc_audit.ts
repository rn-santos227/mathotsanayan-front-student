  `The Student Audit Trail feature in MatHotSanayan provides students with
  a comprehensive record of their activities within the web application.
  This feature allows students to track their interactions, including
  accessing modules, submitting assessments, and engaging with learning
  resources. By offering transparency and accountability, the audit trail
  empowers students to monitor their own progress and learning journey
  effectively.`,

  `In addition to viewing their activities, students can utilize the search
  functionality to filter the audit trail based on specific criteria. By
  entering keywords or parameters such as activity type, feature
  interacted, or timestamp, students can narrow down the audit trail to
  focus on relevant information. This search capability enables students
  to identify patterns in their usage patterns and track their engagement
  with different features of the application.`,

  `Furthermore, students have the option to reset the search list,
  providing a convenient way to clear previous search filters and view the
  complete audit trail. This feature enhances flexibility and ease of use,
  allowing students to seamlessly navigate through their activity history
  and gain insights into their learning habits. Whether reviewing recent
  activities or exploring past interactions, the ability to reset the
  search list ensures a streamlined and efficient experience for students
  in monitoring their progress within the web application.`,

  `The Audit Trail Detail function in MatHotSanayan offers students a
  deeper insight into their activity history within the web application,
  providing additional details such as IP addresses and content associated
  with each action. This feature enhances transparency and enables
  students to monitor their interactions with greater precision.`,

  `In addition to standard activity records, the Audit Trail Detail
  function includes information about the IP addresses from which each
  action occurred. By displaying the IP address associated with each
  activity, students can track the locations or devices used to access the
  application. This enhances security and allows students to verify the
  legitimacy of their own actions while using the web application.`,

  `Moreover, the Audit Trail Detail function provides access to additional
  content or context related to specific actions. This may include details
  such as the specific module or assessment accessed, the duration of
  interaction, or any associated actions performed by the student. By
  offering more comprehensive information, students can gain deeper
  insights into their activity history and better understand their
  engagement with the application.`,

  `Overall, the Audit Trail Detail function empowers students to take a
  more detailed and informed approach to monitoring their activity within
  the web application. By providing access to IP addresses and additional
  content associated with each action, this feature promotes transparency,
  security, and accountability, ultimately enhancing the student
  experience.`,
