  `The Audit Trail feature gives students a detailed record of what they do
  in the platform, like logging in, accessing modules, and taking exams.
  This feature serves the purpose of enhancing transparency,
  accountability, and security within the platform by documenting user
  activity.`,

  `In addition to viewing their activities, students can utilize the search
  functionality to filter the audit trail based on specific criteria. By
  entering keywords or parameters such as activity type, feature
  interacted, or timestamp, students can narrow down the audit trail to
  focus on relevant information. This search capability enables students
  to identify patterns in their usage patterns and track their engagement
  with different features of the application.`,

  `Furthermore, students have the option to reset the search list,
  providing a convenient way to clear previous search filters and view the
  complete audit trail. This feature enhances flexibility and ease of use,
  allowing students to seamlessly navigate through their activity history
  and gain insights into their learning habits. Whether reviewing recent
  activities or exploring past interactions, the ability to reset the
  search list ensures a streamlined and efficient experience for students
  in monitoring their progress within the platform.`,
