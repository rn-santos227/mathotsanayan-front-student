  `The Exam Page is crafted to make test-taking and progress tracking
  effortless. This dynamic page offers a user-friendly interface, smoothly
  guiding students through every step of the examination process.`,

  `When students enter the Exam Page, questions appear one by one, helping
  them focus and think carefully about each one. To answer a question,
  students type their response in a provided space and click the answer
  button. This structured method ensures clarity and simplicity as students
  move through the assessment.`,

  `Real-time feedback is integral to the test-taking experience in
  MatHOTSanayan. After submitting an answer to a question, students receive
  immediate feedback, indicating whether the response is correct or
  incorrect. This instant validation allows students to monitor their
  performance in real-time, enabling them to adjust their strategy and focus
  on areas that require further attention.`,

  `Providing a sample solution once the studentâ€™s answer is correct is a
  valuable feature for learning. It reinforces the correct solution in the
  student's memory, making it easier to remember. It also helps students who
  guessed the answer by showing them the right approach. Moreover, seeing a
  sample solution helps students understand what's expected and how well
  they're doing. This transparency builds trust in the evaluation process
  and keeps students motivated.`,

  `MatHOTSanayan understands the value of learning from mistakes and offers
  three attempts for answering each question before moving on. This feature
  encourages a growth mindset, allowing students to refine their
  understanding and problem-solving skills through iterative learning. It
  also promotes persistence and resilience, fostering a positive learning
  experience.`,

  `MatHOTSanayan recognizes the importance of second chances. After
  successfully answering all remaining questions, students are given the
  opportunity to revisit and answer the questions they had initially
  skipped. The system automatically displays these skipped questions in
  random order. This feature ensures a comprehensive assessment of
  knowledge, encourages flexible learning with random question presentation,
  and allows a personalized exam approach. It also supports learning
  reinforcement, reduces stress by offering another chance for unanswered
  questions, and empowers students with control over their exam experience,
  boosting confidence and engagement.`,

  `MatHOTSanayan acknowledges the significance of offering students choices
  in their learning journey. Giving students choices, such as after three
  incorrect attempts, to either try answering the question again or proceed
  to the next one or the option to either retry the skipped questions or
  leave and submit the exam as incomplete.`,

  `Offering options like retrying questions after three incorrect attempts or
  choosing to skip questions and proceed to the next one acknowledges that
  students learn at different paces and have different strengths and
  weaknesses. This helps students learn from their mistakes while also
  keeping the exam moving forward if they're stuck on a tough question. This
  flexibility empowers students to manage the exam at their own pace and
  strategically handle their responses.`,

  `Additionally, providing the option to leave the current exam and submit it
  as incomplete prioritizes student well-being and acknowledges the
  potential impact of external factors on their performance, while offering
  the opportunity to retry skipped questions encourages persistence,
  critical thinking, and learning from mistakes. Together, these choices
  contribute to a more inclusive, supportive, and effective assessment
  environment.`,
