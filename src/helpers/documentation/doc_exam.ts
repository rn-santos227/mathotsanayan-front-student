  `Welcome to the Exam Page in MatHotSanayan, the platform designed to
  facilitate assessment-taking and progress monitoring. This dynamic page
  provides a user-friendly interface, guiding users through each step of the
  examination process seamlessly.`,

  `Upon entering the Exam Page, questions are presented one at a time,
  allowing students to focus their attention and thoughtfully consider each
  query. Navigation between questions is intuitive, either through the
  provided navigation buttons or by selecting the question number from the
  question panel. This structured approach ensures clarity and ease of use
  as students progress through the assessment.`,

  `As students encounter each question, they have the option to answer it or
  defer if uncertain. This flexibility empowers individuals to approach the
  exam at their own pace and strategically manage their responses. If a
  student chooses to answer, they can select their response and move on to
  the next question. Alternatively, if unsure about a question, it can be
  skipped and returned to later for further consideration.`,

  `MatHotSanayan recognizes the importance of learning from mistakes and
  offers multiple attempts for answering each question. This feature
  encourages a growth mindset, allowing students to refine their
  understanding and problem-solving skills through iterative learning.
  However, after three incorrect attempts, the system will automatically
  mark the question as incorrect, promoting efficient progress through the
  exam.`,

  `Real-time feedback is integral to the exam-taking experience in
  MatHotSanayan. Upon submitting an answer to a question, immediate feedback
  is provided, indicating whether the response is correct or incorrect. This
  instant validation allows students to monitor their performance in
  real-time, enabling them to adjust their strategy and focus on areas that
  require further attention.`,

  `By leveraging the features available on the Exam Page effectively,
  students can approach assessments with confidence, optimize their
  exam-taking strategy, and ultimately achieve their academic goals. Whether
  aiming to master course content, track progress, or prepare for upcoming
  evaluations, MatHotSanayan's Exam Page provides the tools and support
  needed for success.`,
