  `Navigate through MatHOTSanayan's List of Available Modules page to access
  available modules of student’s chosen subject. This user-friendly feature
  allows students to choose modules based on their ongoing learning journey.`,

  `The module labeled “Stage 1” represents the initial step for students,
  serving as the gateway to accessing subsequent modules. Initially, only
  this module is accessible, while others remain inaccessible. Students must
  complete and submit their results for the Stage 1 module to unlock the
  next stage, labeled as "Stage 2." This sequence continues until all
  modules are accessible. This feature is designed to help students
  understand the subject thoroughly and remember concepts better. By
  gradually strengthening their knowledge before dealing with tougher
  problems, students establish a solid foundation. This systematic method
  streamlines the learning process, providing a well-organized path to
  mastery. It ensures students are adequately prepared to tackle more
  complex concepts as they progress through the modules.`,

  `After unlocking all modules, students have unlimited access to revisit and
  practice any module within the subject as often as necessary to master the
  topic. This feature offers students the flexibility to adjust their
  learning pace while ensuring a thorough understanding of the subject
  matter.`,

  `To get started, students should choose their desired subject from the list
  of options on the List of Available Modules page. Each subject will
  display the modules accessible based on the student's current progress
  stage.`,

  `Next, students need to click the "take exam" button for the module labeled
  "Stage 1." Here, they'll find the module's description and objectives,
  helping them understand the content before proceeding.`,

  `Clear instructions are also provided to guide students through the
  assessment process, including how to navigate the exam interface, answer
  questions, and submit responses effectively. This empowers students to
  approach assessments with confidence, ultimately improving their learning
  outcomes and academic success.`,

  `Once students have familiarized themselves with the module's description,
  objectives, and instructions, they should click the "proceed" button to
  begin taking the exam.`,
