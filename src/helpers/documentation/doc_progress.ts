  `        The Progress/Results table serves as a comprehensive tool for students
  to monitor their academic journey and assess their performance. It
  offers a detailed outline of their performance across various modules,
  providing invaluable insights into their progress. Each entry within the
  table includes essential details such as the module title, module stage,
  score, remarks, and the total time spent on the exam. This organized
  presentation allows students to easily monitor their advancements and
  identify areas where they excel or may require additional focus.`,

  `        The Progress/Results table goes beyond showing basic information, giving
  students the power to explore their assessment results further. By
  clicking on the action button for each assessment, students can get more
  detailed insights and feedback. This lets them review their answers to
  specific questions, see how they're doing over time, and find areas to
  work on. Whether they want to build on their strengths or improve their
  weaknesses, students can use this feature to make their learning
  experience better and reach their academic goals.`,

  `        Moreover, the table is easy to use, so students can find what they need
  quickly. It clearly shows the difference between passing and failing
  grades, making it simple for students to see how they're doing overall
  and track their progress. By using the Progress/Results table to keep an
  eye on their academic progress, students can take charge of their
  learning, make smart choices, and keep getting better.`,

  `The Result Details section in MatHOTSanayan provides a comprehensive
  breakdown of students' assessment outcomes, offering insights into their
  performance and areas for improvement. This segment begins by presenting
  essential information such as the module name, indicating the specific
  assessment undertaken by the student, and the result, clearly
  distinguishing between passing and failing grades. Additionally,
  students can review the total time taken to complete the assessment and
  the average time spent per question, providing valuable context for
  their performance.`,

  `Numerical results further enhance students' understanding of their
  assessment performance. The section includes details such as the total
  score achieved over the total number of items, offering a quantitative
  measure of students' proficiency in the subject matter. The percentage
  grade provides a standardized assessment of their performance relative
  to the assessment's grading scale. Moreover, students can assess their
  engagement and persistence through metrics such as the total number of
  attempts made across all questions. The accuracy metric, calculated
  based on the average of total items divided by total attempts plus the
  percentage grade, offers a nuanced evaluation of students' performance
  by accounting for both correctness and persistence. Additionally, the
  number of skips, recorded as mistakes, sheds light on students'
  decision-making processes during the assessment.`,

  `The third segment of the Result Details section features a detailed
  table outlining each question and the corresponding responses provided
  by the student. This granular view allows students to review their
  answers systematically, identify patterns in their responses, and
  reflect on their problem-solving strategies. By analyzing individual
  question responses, students can gain insights into their strengths and
  weaknesses, enabling targeted improvements in their understanding and
  approach to similar assessments in the future. Overall, the Result
  Details section empowers students to take ownership of their learning
  journey, make informed decisions, and strive for continuous improvement.`,

  `The Answers Table in MatHOTSanayan provides students with a detailed
  breakdown of their assessment performance, allowing for a comprehensive
  analysis of each question and corresponding responses. This segment
  serves as a valuable tool for students to delve into the intricacies of
  their answers, facilitating a thorough evaluation of their understanding
  and proficiency in the assessment material.`,

  `Each entry in the table encompasses several critical components
  essential for a nuanced assessment review. Firstly, the Evaluation
  column offers students immediate feedback on the correctness of their
  answers, aiding in the assessment of their overall performance. This
  clear distinction between correct and incorrect responses enables
  students to identify areas of strength and pinpoint concepts requiring
  further attention.`,

  `Secondly, the Answer Content column presents the responses provided by
  the student for each question, juxtaposed with the correct solution.
  This juxtaposition allows students to compare their answers directly
  with the expected response, facilitating a deeper understanding of any
  misconceptions or errors. By scrutinizing their answers in this manner,
  students can identify specific areas for improvement and refine their
  problem-solving strategies effectively.`,

  `Furthermore, the Question Content column provides the context necessary
  for students to interpret and analyze each question thoroughly.
  Understanding the nuances of the question prompts enables students to
  ensure they have addressed all aspects of the problem and applied the
  appropriate concepts in their responses. Additionally, the table
  includes metrics such as Attempt Number and Time Spent, offering
  insights into students' persistence, engagement, and time management
  skills during the assessment. This comprehensive view of their
  performance empowers students to identify patterns, track progress, and
  make informed decisions to enhance their learning outcomes effectively.`,
