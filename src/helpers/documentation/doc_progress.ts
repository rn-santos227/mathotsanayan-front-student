  `The Progress/Results table serves as a comprehensive tool for students
  to monitor their academic journey and assess their performance. It
  offers a detailed outline of their performance across various modules,
  providing invaluable insights into their progress. Each entry within the
  table includes essential details such as the module title, module stage,
  score, remarks, and the total time spent on the exam. This organized
  presentation allows students to easily monitor their advancements and
  identify areas where they excel or may require additional focus.`,

  `The Progress/Results table goes beyond showing basic information, giving
  students the power to explore their assessment results further. By
  clicking on the action button for each assessment, students can get more
  detailed insights and feedback. This lets them review their answers to
  specific questions, see how they're doing over time, and find areas to
  work on. Whether they want to build on their strengths or improve their
  weaknesses, students can use this feature to make their learning
  experience better and reach their academic goals.`,

  `Moreover, the table is easy to use, so students can find what they need
  quickly. It clearly shows the difference between passing and failing
  grades, making it simple for students to see how they're doing overall
  and track their progress. By using the Progress/Results table to keep an
  eye on their academic progress, students can take charge of their
  learning, make smart choices, and keep getting better.`,

  `The Progress/Result Details section gives students a thorough breakdown
  of their assessment outcomes, providing valuable insights into their
  performance and areas for growth. It starts by showing key information
  like the module title, indicating which assessment the student took, and
  the results, clearly showing whether they passed or failed. Students can
  also see how long it took them to finish the exam and the average time
  spent on each question, giving context to their performance.`,

  `Numerical results, such as the raw score compared to the total number of
  items, give a quantitative measure of how well they know the topic. The
  percentage grade shows how their performance compares to the grading
  scale.`,

  `Students can gauge their engagement and persistence by looking at
  metrics like the total number of attempts made on all questions. The
  accuracy metric, calculated based on the average of total items divided
  by total attempts plus the percentage grade, gives a detailed evaluation
  of their performance by considering both correctness and persistence.
  Additionally, the number of skips, counted as mistakes, shows how
  students made decisions during the assessment.`,

  `The third segment of the Progress/Results Details section is a detailed
  table showing each question and the student's responses. This detailed
  view lets students review their answers systematically, spot patterns in
  their responses, and think about their problem-solving strategies. By
  analyzing individual question responses, students can understand their
  strengths and weaknesses, making it easier to improve in similar
  assessments in the future.`,

  `Overall, the Progress/Results Details section helps students take
  control of their learning journey, make smart choices, and strive for
  continuous improvement.`,

  `The Response Details provides students with a detailed breakdown of
  their responses, allowing them to analyze each question and their
  corresponding responses in detail. This section serves as a valuable
  tool for students to explore the details of their answers, enabling a
  detailed evaluation of their understanding and proficiency in the exam.`,

  `Each entry in the table includes several critical components essential
  for a detailed assessment review. The Response Category column offers
  students immediate feedback on the correctness of their response,
  assisting them in evaluating their overall performance. This clear
  distinction between correct and incorrect responses enables students to
  identify areas of strength and pinpoint concepts requiring further
  attention.`,

  `The Response column displays the responses or answers provided by the
  student for each respective question, positioned between the Response
  Category column and the Question column. This layout enables a
  straightforward comparison between the student's responses and the
  corresponding questions, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of
  their performance. By carefully reviewing their answers this way,
  students can pinpoint areas for improvement and enhance their
  problem-solving strategies. Additionally, the Question Content column
  provides specific details, information, or instructions provided in a
  question prompt, which guide students in understanding what is being
  asked of them. The question content is essential for students to
  interpret the question accurately and provide a relevant and correct
  response.`,

  `Additionally, the table includes metrics such as Attempt Number and Time
  Spent, offering insights into students' persistence, engagement, and
  time management skills during the assessment. This helps students
  identify patterns, monitor progress, and make smart choices to improve
  their learning results.`,
