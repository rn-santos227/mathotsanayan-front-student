  performance and track their progress over time. By utilizing the

  `The Result Details section in MatHotSanayan provides a comprehensive
  breakdown of students' assessment outcomes, offering insights into their
  performance and areas for improvement. This segment begins by presenting
  essential information such as the module name, indicating the specific
  assessment undertaken by the student, and the result, clearly

  measure of students' proficiency in the subject matter. The percentage
  grade provides a standardized assessment of their performance relative
  to the assessment's grading scale. Moreover, students can assess their
  engagement and persistence through metrics such as the total number of
  attempts made across all questions. The accuracy metric, calculated
  based on the average of total items divided by total attempts plus the
  percentage grade, offers a nuanced evaluation of students' performance
  by accounting for both correctness and persistence. Additionally, the
  number of skips, recorded as mistakes, sheds light on students'
  decision-making processes during the assessment.`,

  question responses, students can gain insights into their strengths and
  weaknesses, enabling targeted improvements in their understanding and
  approach to similar assessments in the future. Overall, the Result
  Details section empowers students to take ownership of their learning
  journey, make informed decisions, and strive for continuous improvement.`,
