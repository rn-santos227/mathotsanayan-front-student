  `        The Progress/Results table serves as a comprehensive tool for students
  to monitor their academic journey and assess their performance. It
  offers a detailed outline of their performance across various modules,
  providing invaluable insights into their progress. Each entry within the
  table includes essential details such as the module title, module stage,
  score, remarks, and the total time spent on the exam. This organized
  presentation allows students to easily monitor their advancements and
  identify areas where they excel or may require additional focus.`,

  `        The Progress/Results table goes beyond showing basic information, giving
  students the power to explore their assessment results further. By
  clicking on the action button for each assessment, students can get more
  detailed insights and feedback. This lets them review their answers to
  specific questions, see how they're doing over time, and find areas to
  work on. Whether they want to build on their strengths or improve their
  weaknesses, students can use this feature to make their learning
  experience better and reach their academic goals.`,

  `        Moreover, the table is easy to use, so students can find what they need
  quickly. It clearly shows the difference between passing and failing
  grades, making it simple for students to see how they're doing overall
  and track their progress. By using the Progress/Results table to keep an
  eye on their academic progress, students can take charge of their
  learning, make smart choices, and keep getting better.`,

  `        The Progress/Result Details section gives students a thorough breakdown
  of their assessment outcomes, providing valuable insights into their
  performance and areas for growth. It starts by showing key information
  like the module title, indicating which assessment the student took, and
  the results, clearly showing whether they passed or failed. Students can
  also see how long it took them to finish the exam and the average time
  spent on each question, giving context to their performance.`,

  `        Numerical results, such as the raw score compared to the total number of
  items, give a quantitative measure of how well they know the topic. The
  percentage grade shows how their performance compares to the grading
  scale.`,

  `   Students can gauge their engagement and persistence by looking at
  metrics like the total number of attempts made on all questions. The
  accuracy metric, calculated based on the average of total items divided
  by total attempts plus the percentage grade, gives a detailed evaluation
  of their performance by considering both correctness and persistence.
  Additionally, the number of skips, counted as mistakes, shows how
  students made decisions during the assessment.`,

  `        The third segment of the Progress/Results Details section is a detailed
  table showing each question and the student's responses. This detailed
  view lets students review their answers systematically, spot patterns in
  their responses, and think about their problem-solving strategies. By
  analyzing individual question responses, students can understand their
  strengths and weaknesses, making it easier to improve in similar
  assessments in the future.`,

  `        Overall, the Progress/Results Details section helps students take
  control of their learning journey, make smart choices, and strive for
  continuous improvement.`,

  `Secondly, the Answer Content column presents the responses provided by
  the student for each question, juxtaposed with the correct solution.
  This juxtaposition allows students to compare their answers directly
  with the expected response, facilitating a deeper understanding of any
  misconceptions or errors. By scrutinizing their answers in this manner,
  students can identify specific areas for improvement and refine their
  problem-solving strategies effectively.`,

  `Furthermore, the Question Content column provides the context necessary
  for students to interpret and analyze each question thoroughly.
  Understanding the nuances of the question prompts enables students to
  ensure they have addressed all aspects of the problem and applied the
  appropriate concepts in their responses. Additionally, the table
  includes metrics such as Attempt Number and Time Spent, offering
  insights into students' persistence, engagement, and time management
  skills during the assessment. This comprehensive view of their
  performance empowers students to identify patterns, track progress, and
  make informed decisions to enhance their learning outcomes effectively.`,
